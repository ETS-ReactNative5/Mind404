# Grubber

Grubber is a program that provides a consumer the autonomous ability to quickly hire people for odd jobs the typical person is not normally fond of, all within one app. Whether it is lawn care, indoor house cleaning services, pressure washing and much more, you have the ability to receive an instant estimated quote and purchase these services at the touch of a button.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_czZZ8qTIG6V1sBmGGpt5doHKe01koHvBUY1MGQVu9Z5VZL4kSrSd0aAuH7EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
   * Android Studio is recommended as the primary emulator for the app.  Once downloaded, proceed to create a new AVD running Android 10.0 and API 29.
   * You may also choose to use the Expo client app on your mobile device, downloadable in the google play store
* CLI command line utility
   * To do this, enter the following command into your terminal
        >  npm install -g expo-cli
* A Code editor, to view and edit code
    * We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) available on all OS's
## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
